Port 80 (8055) - DIST MODE ONLY
 General port used for streaming to clients.  This typically will be in mp3 or flv format depending on URL needs

Port 8100 - MASTER MODE ONLY
 Accepts AU format (PCM 16-bit mono) audio.  Makes this data available on the outside as well.  
 
Port 8101 - MASTER MODE ONLY
 Sends SMSD V1 audio/control data once connected as seen below.  DIST or RELAY servers will use this port
 to establish distributions.

Port 8102 - MASTER MODE ONLY
 Collects statistical data (not yet implemented)

Port 8105 - MASTER MODE ONLY
 Command Channel...should you want to inject commands :D

Datums

	The datums are the individual packet components and may consist of differing types.  Type 1 is just simple Audio, 
	which means the reader is expected to unpack it, concatenate the packets, and transcode them into appropriate types.

	Type 1 can be used for such things as commercial injections or air shut down.
